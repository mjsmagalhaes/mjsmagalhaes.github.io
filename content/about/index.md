## Hello!

My name is Marcos and this will be my page.

## My Interests

Professionally, my main interest is working with data (basically doing any cool stuff with cool data).

I am also interested in (using) programming languages. Over the years I've used: LabView's G, Matlab, R, Java, Lua, C/C++ (in no particular order). More recently python and Javascript.

On my spare time, I try to be a decent World of Warcraft player .... I've been trying for nearly two decades ...

And sometimes I get to toy with data from World of Warcraft joining both of my interests XD

### As a side note

Hello, I am Marcos and I am testing Hugo.
